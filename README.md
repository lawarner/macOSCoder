# macOSCoder
Run code samples in macOS

This project I put together as a framework for running code samples, testing algorithms and has
a subclass adapted to CodeJam (or TopCoder) style of input, processing and output. When run a
macOS Cocoa window is presented that allows the various tests classes and methods to be selected
and optional parameters to be input. The output of each test is presented in a scrollingi text
window.

A sample solution and the Dictionary class are included as examples of usage, but the project is
intended to provide a framework for adding new tests and samples.
